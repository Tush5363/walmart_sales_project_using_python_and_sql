Walmart Sales Analysis Project (Python + PostgreSQL)
📌 Overview
This project is an end-to-end data analysis solution designed to extract critical business insights from Walmart sales data.
We utilize Python for data processing and analysis, SQL for advanced querying, and structured problem-solving techniques to solve key business questions.
The project is ideal for data analysts looking to develop skills in data manipulation, SQL querying, and data pipeline creation.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Language: Python 3.8+
